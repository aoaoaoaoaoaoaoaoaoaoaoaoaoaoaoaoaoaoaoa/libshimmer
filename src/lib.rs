//! Animated status lines for terminal UIs, paced by the host's work.
//!
//! A [`Shimmer`] is one running animation, made from a [`Recipe`] of [`stock::ROSTER`]. It dresses
//! a caption, such as "Working", and paints the status line's lead (a mark of glyphs, the
//! caption's letters, and a tail of cells after them) over a backdrop of background colors. It
//! also paints the bullet in front of a running sub-task, such as a tool call.
//!
//! The host drives a shimmer with commands, each holding until the next replaces it:
//! [`Shimmer::show`] sets the caption, [`Shimmer::set_spell`] what the host is doing, and
//! [`Shimmer::set_intensity`] how hard it works. Each frame, the host passes the time elapsed since
//! the previous frame to [`Shimmer::advance`], which runs whole ticks of [`TICK`], and draws the
//! [`Row`] that [`Shimmer::status`] paints. Paint depends only on the recipe, the seed, the
//! commands so far, the [`Palette`], and the [`Motion`]: libshimmer reads no clock or environment
//! and keeps no global state.
//!
//! A host that learns of work in lumps can smooth them with a [`Reservoir`], and a picker can
//! preview a recipe by playing the [`script`]. The `ratatui` feature converts a row into ratatui
//! spans and lays its backdrop into a ratatui buffer.
//!
