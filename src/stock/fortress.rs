//! Fortress: a dwarf miner digs the caption, drawn as Dwarf Fortress draws its classic ASCII
//! fortresses. The caption is rock, tinted beneath its letters by the level's stone, and work
//! swings the pick: a dug letter fades to floor. A finished corridor ends in a down stair, and the
//! fortress persists from bout to bout, digging ever deeper through soil, stone, the caverns and
//! the magma sea to raw adamantine and the underworld beneath it. Warm or damp stone gives the
//! miner pause before he breaches magma or water, which floods the corridor; giant cave spiders,
//! fire imps and demons chase him toward the up stair, goblin sieges come down it while he digs
//! on, his job never cancelled, and a dwarf on fire flashes red and yellow. About once every
//! quarter hour of work the fun is fatal, and migrants take up the pick; the underworld ends the
//! fortress, and a new one embarks. While the host waits the miner has no job and shows `?`;
//! between bouts he sleeps, now and then a `Z`.
