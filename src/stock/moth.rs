//! Moth: a moth worries the lamp at the head of the line. Lamplight warms the first letters and
//! falls away along the caption; whenever the moth crosses between bulb and words, its shadow, huge
//! as it nears the glass, sweeps across them. Work burns the lamp full and drives the moth faster,
//! a burst of output now and then into the bulb. A wait sinks the lamp to half, and the moth rests
//! beside it, now and then taking a turn about it; between bouts the lamp is a breathing
//! night-light, beside which the moth rests, now and then fluttering in place.
